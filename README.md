## Development instructions

### Important Files 
* TheAddon.java: this is the addon-on component class. You can add more classes if you wish, including other Components.
* TestView.java: A View class that let's you test the component you are building. This and other classes in the test folder will not be packaged during the build. You can add more test view classes in this package.
* assembly/: this folder includes configuration for packaging the project into a JAR so that it works well with other Vaadin projects and the Vaadin Directory. There is usually no need to modify these files, unless you need to add JAR manifest entries.

If you are using static resources such as images, JS (e.g. templates) and CSS files the correct location for them is under the `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/frontend` directory and is described here [Resource Cheat Sheet](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/importing-dependencies/tutorial-ways-of-importing.html#resource-cheat-sheet)in more details. 

### Deployment

Starting the test/demo server:
```
mvn jetty:run -Pdevelopment
```

This deploys demo at http://localhost:8080
 
### Integration test

To run Integration Tests, execute `mvn verify -Pit,production`.

Tests run by default in `headless` mode, to avoid browser windows to be opened for every test.
This behaviour is always disabled when running the tests in debug mode in the IDE
or when running maven with the `-Dmaven.failsafe.debug` sytem property.
On normal execution, headless mode can be deactivated using the `-Dtest.headless=false` system property.

## Publishing to Vaadin Directory

You should change the `organization.name` property in `pom.xml` to your own name/organization.

```
    <organization>
        <name>###author###</name>
    </organization>
```

You can create the zip package needed for [Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory/) using

```
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0.0 # You cannot publish snapshot versions 
mvn clean package -Pdirectory
```

The package is created as `target/{project-name}-1.0.0.zip`
